making security-related decisions.","help":"# User-controlled bypass of security check\nUsing user-controlled data in a permissions check may allow a user to gain unauthorized access to protected functionality or data.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nWhen checking whether a user is authorized for a particular activity, do not use data that is entirely controlled by that user in the permissions check. If necessary, always validate the input, ideally against a fixed list of expected values.\n\nSimilarly, do not decide which permission to check for, based on user data. In particular, avoid using computation to decide which permissions to check for. Use fixed permissions for particular actions, rather than generating the permission to check for.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example, we have a server that shows private information for a user, based on the request parameter `userId`. For privacy reasons, users may only view their own private information, so the server checks that the request parameter `userId` matches a cookie value for the user who is logged in.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n// ...\napp.get('/full-profile/:userId', function(req, res) {\n\n    if (req.cookies.loggedInUserId !== req.params.userId) {\n        // BAD: login decision made based on user controlled data\n        requireLogin();\n    } else {\n        // ... show private information\n    }\n\n});\n\n```\nThis security check is, however, insufficient since an attacker can craft their cookie values to match those of any user. To prevent this, the server can cryptographically sign the security critical cookie values:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n// ...\napp.get('/full-profile/:userId', function(req, res) {\n\n    if (req.signedCookies.loggedInUserId !== req.params.userId) {\n        // GOOD: login decision made based on server controlled data\n        requireLogin();\n    } else {\n        // ... show private information\n    }\n\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-807](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/807.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-290](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.24.0"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:upload","environment":"{}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"0125495373eb1b67f2880e28b86b88c52c944013","message":{"text":"This condition guards a sensitive action, but a user-provided value controls it.\nThis condition guards a sensitive action, but a user-provided value controls it."},"location":{"path":"backend/controllers/passkeyController.js","start_line":186,"end_line":186,"start_column":13,"end_column":18},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/itsmepratikg/MapRecruit.ai-TypeScript-/code-scanning/alerts/168/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null,"assignees":[]},{"number":167,"created_at":"2026-01-29T14:47:56Z","updated_at":"2026-01-29T14:47:56Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/itsmepratikg/MapRecruit.ai-TypeScript-/code-scanning/alerts/167","html_url":"https://github.com/itsmepratikg/MapRecruit.ai-TypeScript-/security/code-scanning/167","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/sql-injection","severity":"error","description":"Database query built from user-controlled sources","name":"js/sql-injection","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-089","external/cwe/cwe-090","external/cwe/cwe-943","security"],"full_description":"Building a database query from user-controlled sources is vulnerable to insertion of malicious code by the user.","help":"# Database query built from user-controlled sources\nIf a database query (such as a SQL or NoSQL query) is built from user-provided data without sufficient sanitization, a malicious user may be able to run malicious database queries.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nMost database connector libraries offer a way of safely embedding untrusted data into a query by means of query parameters or prepared statements.\n\nFor NoSQL queries, make use of an operator like MongoDB's `$eq` to ensure that untrusted data is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object. Alternatively, check that the untrusted data is a literal value and not a query object before using it in a query.\n\nFor SQL queries, use query parameters or prepared statements to embed untrusted data into the query string, or use a library like `sqlstring` to escape untrusted data.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, assume the function `handler` is an HTTP request handler in a web application, whose parameter `req` contains the request object.\n\nThe handler constructs an SQL query string from user input and executes it as a database query using the `pg` library. The user input may contain quote characters, so this code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n  var query1 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\" +\n    req.params.category +\n    \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query1, [], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can use query parameters to embed the user input into the query string. In this example, we use the API offered by the `pg` Postgres database connector library, but other libraries offer similar features.

This version is immune to injection attacks.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // GOOD: use parameters\n  var query2 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=$1 ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query2, [req.params.category], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, we can use a library like `sqlstring` to escape the user input before embedding it into the query string:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      SqlString = require('sqlstring'),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the category is escaped using mysql.escape\n  var query1 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\" +\n    SqlString.escape(req.params.category) +\n    \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query1, [], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an express handler attempts to delete a single document from a MongoDB collection. The document to be deleted is identified by its `_id` field, which is constructed from user input. The user input may contain a query object, so this code is vulnerable to a NoSQL injection attack.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst mongoose = require(\"mongoose\");\nconst Todo = mongoose.model(\n  \"Todo\",\n  new mongoose.Schema({ text: { type: String } }, { timestamps: true })\n);\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\n\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // BAD: id might be an object with special properties\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can use the `$eq` operator to ensure that the user input is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: { $eq: id } }); // GOOD: using $eq operator for the comparison\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n```\nAlternatively check that the user input is a literal value and not a query object before using it:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  if (typeof id !== \"string\") {\n    res.status(400).json({ status: \"error\" });\n    return;\n  }\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // GOOD: id is guaranteed to be a string\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).\n* MongoDB: [$eq operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/eq).\n* OWASP: [NoSQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-90](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-943](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/943.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.24.0"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":"dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql:upload","environment":"{}","category":"/language:javascript-typescript","state":"open","commit_sha":"0125495373eb1b67f2880e28b86b88c52c944013","message":{"text":"This query object depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"backend/controllers/authController.js","start_line":134,"end_line":134,"start_column":41,"end_column":50},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/itsmepratikg/MapRecruit.ai-TypeScript-/code-scanning/alerts/160/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null,"assignees":[]},{"number":159,"created_at":"2026-01-29T14:47:56Z","updated_at":"2026-01-29T14:47:56Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/itsmepratikg/MapRecruit.ai-TypeScript-/code-scanning/alerts/159","html_url":"https://github.com/itsmepratikg/MapRecruit.ai-TypeScript-/security/code-scanning/159","state":"open","fixed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"rule":{"id":"js/missing-rate-limiting","severity":"warning","description":"Missing rate limiting","name":"js/missing-rate-limiting","tags":["external/cwe/cwe-307","external/cwe/cwe-400","external/cwe/cwe-770","security"],"full_description":"An HTTP request handler that performs expensive operations without restricting the rate at which operations can be carried out is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.","help":"# Missing rate limiting\nHTTP request handlers should not perform expensive operations such as accessing the file system, executing an operating system command or interacting with a database without limiting the rate at which requests are accepted.
